Opaque linear system solver for Berlekamp-Welch decoding.

Solves the matrix equation A·x = b for x, where:
- A is an n × m coefficient matrix
- b is a length-n RHS vector
Returning either:
- `some x` if a solution exists
- `none` if the system is inconsistent

### Parameters:
- `A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin m) F` - Coefficient matrix with dimensions n × m
- `b : Fin n → F` - Right-hand side vector of length n

### Returns:
- `some x` where `x : Fin m → F` is a solution vector if one exists
- `none` if the system has no solution

### Behavior:
1. For consistent systems (solutions exist):
   - Returns any valid solution 
2. For inconsistent systems (no solution):
   - Returns `none`

### Implementation Notes:
- Marked `opaque` because:
  - There is no means currently to provide the definition using Mathlib (`sorry` under the hood).
- Used internally by the Berlekamp-Welch decoder

**Solution correctness theorem** for the linear system solver.

### Theorem Statement:
If `linsolve` returns `some x`, then `x` is indeed a solution to the linear system.

### Parameters:
- `A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin m) F` - Coefficient matrix
- `b : Fin n → F` - Right-hand side vector
- `x : Fin m → F` - Candidate solution vector
- `h : linsolve A b = some x` - Proof that the solver returned this solution

**Inconsistency theorem** for the linear system solver.

### Theorem Statement:
If `linsolve` returns `none`, the linear system has no solution.

### Parameters:
- `A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin m) F` - Coefficient matrix
- `b : Fin n → F` - Right-hand side vector 
- `h : linsolve A b = none` - Proof that the solver failed to find a solution
