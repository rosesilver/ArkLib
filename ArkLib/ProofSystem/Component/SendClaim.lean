  # Simple Oracle Reduction - SendClaim

2. - There is no witness (e.g. `Witness = Unit`), and there is a single `OStatement`.
   - The prover sends a message of the same type as `OStatement` to the verifier.
   - The verifier performs the check for `rel`, which can be expressed as an oracle computation.
   - The output data has no `Statement`, only two `OStatement`s: one from the beginning data,
     and the other is the message from the prover.
   - The output relation checks whether the two `OStatement`s are the same.

The verifier checks that the relationship `rel oldStmt newStmt` holds.
It has access to the original and new `OStatement` via their oracle indices.

Combine the prover and verifier into an oracle reduction.
The input has no statement or witness, but one `OStatement`.
The output is also no statement or witness, but two `OStatement`s.
