\chapter{Introduction}

The goal of this project is to formalize Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (SNARKs) in
Lean. Our focus is on SNARKs based on Interactive Oracle Proofs (IOPs) and variants thereof (i.e.
Polynomial IOPs). We aim to develop a general framework for IOP-based SNARKs with verified, modular
building blocks and transformations. This modular approach enables us to construct complex protocols
from simpler components while ensuring correctness and soundness by construction.
